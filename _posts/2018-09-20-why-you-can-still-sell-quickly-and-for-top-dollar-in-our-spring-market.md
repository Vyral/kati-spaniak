If you’re looking to sell your home, it’s not too late to hit the spring market.

The reason why it’s important for sellers to hit the spring market is the schools. Many schools in our area start earlier and earlier, typically around mid-August, and these schools won’t accept a housing contract that’s contingent. They’re willing to accept a contract that’s closed, though, **so your home has to close before the new homeowners can register in the school system.**

Typically, if your buyer is coming from Chicago, they want to be in their home and know where they’re kids are going to school, which means you’re looking at a closing date of late July or mid-August. Remember, it usually takes 30 to 45 days from the time your home is listed to when it’s under contract, and that’s only if it’s priced correctly. From contract to closing, it usually takes another 30 to 45 days.

So, what steps do you need to take to put your home on the market right now?

First, **call your Realtor.** Get them in your house as soon as possible. They know what the market’s doing and what buyers are looking for. They’ll be your guide to making sure you sell your house quickly. You don’t need to clean or straighten up first—just call them and have them come over as soon as possible.

Your Realtor will be able to tell you exactly what needs to be done in your house. Most of the time, paint goes a long way, but don’t make any upgrades or do any remodeling until you talk to your Realtor and they can tell you what to do to get the most money and help you sell in the quickest time.

Also, sign with your Realtor today and get your house listed in the private network. The private network is a behind-the-scenes MLS feature that all agents have access to that allows us to know what’s going on in the market. That way, if someone’s dying to see a house, they can reach out to us Realtors and ask, and it’s up to you when you want to let them in.

The second step is to **get your vendors ready.** Call whoever you need to help you with the house and get on their calendar. Be aware that they need time to work on your house.

Third, **line up your real estate attorney.** It’s important that you know who you will use moving forward, and remember—it has to be a real estate attorney. Real estate attorneys will know the ins and outs of these contracts as they come through.

Lastly, **figure out where you’re going to go.** What if I brought you a contract in 30 days and you still didn’t know where you were going to go? Just listing the house alone can be stressful, but not knowing where you’re going to go is even worse. Make sure you have a plan, and don’t just fold the extra linen in your closet—pack that stuff up and get it out of the way. Start packing other things as well, and make sure you’re mentally committed to the fact that your Realtor is bringing you a contract.

Remember, if your home is not on the market during the spring, that’s okay. Houses sell all year-round, but this is the time when the most buyers are out looking. If you list your home at another time of year, but the process might take longer.
