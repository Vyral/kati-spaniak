Why should you work with the Spaniak Team to meet your real estate goals? Don’t take it from me—let my satisfied clients do the talking.

John Demakis, one such client, had this to say:

“My wife and I chose the Spaniak Team because we saw the name posted all over the North Shore, and we felt that **there was a certain level of credibility to Kati and her team.** We saw it in the newspaper, we saw it in people’s yards as they were selling their homes. So we said, ‘When the time is right, I’m going to call Kati.’ She did a great job—very accessible. She runs a big business and she has a huge team, but it’s not so big that you lose touch with her.”

Here at the Spaniak Team, we have a team of buyers’ agents and a showing assistant. **If you are looking and your buyer’s agent can’t go out and show you a house, our other agents can.** We are very focused on making sure we serve your schedule and not ours.

What makes us truly different is our ability to understand our clients.

“That was one of the things we appreciated the most about Kati,” John says. “She took the time to really talk to us about not only price point, but also what was important to us. **She understands the North Shore.”**

“There would be houses that would come up, and we would call her and say, ‘Hey, what do you think about this?’ And she would just say, ‘You don’t want to live there. I know what you want, and that’s not it. Let’s find something else.’ There’s a lot of credibility to someone who will tell you no.”

“There’s a level of expertise that she brings to understanding what our needs were. Ultimately, when the house that was right for us came up, she dropped everything. It was on the market for one day. We went and saw it together and she told us it was exactly what we should buy. **It was an amazing process for us.**”
