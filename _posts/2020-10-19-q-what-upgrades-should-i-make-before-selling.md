Many home sellers think they need to make a bunch of updates and upgrades to their home before selling. In reality, they don’t. There are just a few specific things you should focus in on:

**1\. Neutralize the colors in your house.** It needs to be a color that’s not too warm. Stay away from yellows. When buyers are looking at your pictures, they want to see them look like what they see on HGTV. If your pictures aren’t good or look dated, buyers won’t give it a second thought. It doesn’t matter if you personally like the color; it just matters that buyers do. Freshen up the paint on your baseboards, too.

**2\. Do a thorough cleaning of the home.** Take a step back, look at the home, and fix anything that’s obviously in disrepair. Clean the corners, the baseboards, the bathrooms, and the shower grout. Moldy grout is a huge red flag for buyers.

**3\. Make small upgrades to your kitchen and bathrooms.** You don’t have to rip out a whole bathroom or kitchen. It’s expensive and may not bring you the best return. The worst thing you can do is spend too much money upgrading your kitchen or bathroom when it won’t actually get your home sold. Your target market isn’t you; they do things differently and it’s why you need expert advice on your side.

If you take a quick look online, try seeing what houses appeal to you. They’re probably going to look like what I described above. It’s important to do your own research about what homes are selling for top dollar and why.

If you have any questions for me about selling a home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
