Millennial homebuyers have a different way of searching for homes than previous generations in terms of what they’re looking for and what’s important for them. As a home seller, how should you market to this segment of buyers?

The first thing you have to know is millennials are online a lot, so **your home needs to have an online presence and its listing photos have to be outstanding.**

Many young millennial buyers are dual-income buyers, and if they’re married, they may have small children in their family too, which means they’re very busy and typically not engaging agents early on in the home buying process. Because of this, open houses have become a more popular option for them and something you should consider.

Many millennials rent from month to month before they buy their home, so they’re in no hurry to locate the best one they can find for the right price, and a lot of them aren’t willing to sacrifice much either. This is why your home needs to be staged and look great in pictures to bolster its online presence.

Because most millennials start their home search online, **talk to your agent about possible online marketing strategies.** By “online,” I mean your agent’s website, their brokerage’s website, and sites like Zillow.

Another important platform for home advertisements is Facebook. Is your agent doing sponsored ads? Are they boosting their posts? Are they doing videos about your house?

Don’t just focus on what the agent’s brokerage is doing for your house—focus on what the agent themselves is doing. They’re the one who is local and can network digitally on your behalf. Our team has a strong internet presence for all of our home seller clients.
