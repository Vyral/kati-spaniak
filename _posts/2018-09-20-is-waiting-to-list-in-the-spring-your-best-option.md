One question I get asked a lot right now is whether you should wait until spring to list your home. Honestly, this isn’t a good idea. Today I want to take a look at why.

To start with, although the market isn’t as good as it is in the spring, people are always looking for homes. Therefore, if you have a home that you’re thinking about selling, **now’s a better time to get it listed instead of later.**

If you’re one of the people that is worried about a long list time, you should know that this is a fact of the game right now. **Homes are taking a lot longer to sell and there are very few homes going under contract within one week**, so looking at the number of days on market doesn’t mean as much anymore.

If your home is already on the market, you should keep it listed. Taking it off the market for the winter isn’t a good idea, but keeping it on and expecting fewer showings is.

Over the last couple of years I’ve seen a trend of people coming onto the market in the spring. By putting your home on the market then, you could run into too much inventory and be stuck on the market into June, July, or even August. Then, **you may end up doing a price reduction.**

Instead of doing this, you should list early and expect to remain on the market for a longer time frame. This way you won’t end up in July worrying about if you can sell before school starts.

Listing your home now and keeping it listed through the holidays is to your advantage because you don’t have to compete with other listings and still have potential buyers.

If you have any additional questions about listing or buying now, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
