I’ve been talking about the importance of pricing for years. The market has changed a little bit, though, and buyers aren’t as concerned about price as they are about condition. **Even if you’re priced correctly for your home’s condition, it’s a tough sale if there’s a lot of work that needs to be done.**

When buyers go online, they won’t like homes that don’t look ready to go. They won’t see the house in person if there isn’t some emotional connection. If they do walk into your house and it has a lot of obvious deferred maintenance, it’s going to be a tough sell.

**If you’re maybe a year or two out from selling, it's time for you to take care of that deferred maintenance now.** Your roof, windows, HVAC system, etc., should all be checked and in proper working order. Your house needs to be in good condition to sell in this market.

A buyer I worked with recently found a home that was on the market and in great condition. They loved that the roof was new, the mechanicals were in good working order, and the kitchen was fresh and updated with appliances. **Everything in the house had been taken care of, so it was an easy sell.** There was nothing left in the house that needed to be “taken care of.” The only thing that the buyers needed to do was customize it to their liking. This home sold over list price, as will most homes that are in good condition right now.&nbsp; Homes that aren’t in good condition may not sell at all.

If you have any questions for me about the updates and upgrades you should make before you sell, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
