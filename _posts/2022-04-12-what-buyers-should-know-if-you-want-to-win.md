As a buyer, what do you need to do to purchase a house in today’s hot market? Life as a buyer can be challenging, especially if you’ve seen what houses have sold for over the last three months. When I discuss home prices with clients, I’m mainly concerned with two types of values: appraised values and market values.&nbsp;

In today’s environment, **a home’s market value is going to be much higher than its appraised value.** That means there’s a chance that the property may not appraise for the price that you offer on the home. If you’re a buyer using a mortgage and the appraisal comes in for $100,000 less than what you offered for the home, you’ll have to make up the difference somehow. There are three ways to approach this scenario:&nbsp;

**1\. You can get the seller to reduce their price.**

**2\. You, the buyer, can make up the difference.** This option is usually what happens in our market.

**3\. The seller can relist the home. The second option is usually what happens in our market.**

Something else that buyers need to consider is that **you can’t have a mortgage contingency in your contract if you want to win.** Houses usually won't appraise, so if your offer is contingent on the appraisal, you probably won't be able to purchase the home. That’s why, as a listing agent, I ask buyers for proof of funds that shows they have the cash to cover the gap if the home doesn’t appraise.

The final thing to keep in mind as a buyer is that you need to work with an experienced agent who knows how to write offers and negotiate with other agents.
