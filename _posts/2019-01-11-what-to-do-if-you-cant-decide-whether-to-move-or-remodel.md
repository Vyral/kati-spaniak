With spring just around the corner, now is the perfect time to discuss a question I always receive during these early months of the year: **Should you remodel or should you move?**

If you’ve been thinking about taking on a total rehaul of your kitchen, tearing down a wall, or doing any number of other major remodeling projects, this is a question you may want to ask yourself. You may find that the easier solution is to find a new home that better suits your evolving needs, rather than trying to change your current one to elicit the same effect. 

The first thing to realize is that **you can talk to a real estate agent without necessarily committing to purchasing a home.** Many agents are more than happy to speak with you about your circumstances and advise you as to what steps you should take. They can also get you set up on an automated home search, which will alert you when local homes that match your criteria become available. 

After getting set up on this search, you should begin developing a stronger relationship with your agent. This person should become someone you know, like, and trust—someone who truly cares about your best interests and will be honest with you regarding any questions or goals you discuss with them. You should partner with someone who, when you approach them with a question like whether you should remodel or move, won’t default to the latter option just because it would benefit them.

When I sign a buyer’s agreement with a client, for example, I don’t pressure them into moving forward at a pace they aren’t comfortable with. My focus isn’t on getting clients through the pipeline as quickly as possible—**it’s on finding and leveraging opportunities for the people who have entrusted me with their real estate goals.** Buyer’s agreements aren’t designed to be used against you. These documents merely exist to allow you and your agent to work together as effectively as possible. 

Of course, if you are on the fence about whether to remodel or move, **you should speak to a contractor and get price estimates from them, as well.** Between your contractor and your agent, you should be able to get a good idea of how much each option will cost.

Then, after doing your due diligence, the last step is to pick a path and go down it. Straddling the line between these two options indefinitely won’t put you any closer to accomplishing either one. Eventually, you need to commit and stick with your choice. And, assuming you’ve followed all of the steps I outlined for you today, you should be able to move forward with confidence. 

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
