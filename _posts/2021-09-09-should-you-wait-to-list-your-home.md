With the seasons changing, a lot of clients are wondering, “Should I list my home now or wait until the spring?” The answer lies in where our market is heading.&nbsp;

The truth is, **the right time to sell your home is when you’re ready.** In the fall, supply generally decreases, so you don’t have to compete with as many buyers. Meanwhile, supply usually rises in the spring. It’s true that demand also rises in the spring, but this is offset by the increased competition.

People are always looking for homes. Especially in today’s market, **if you want to sell your home for a great deal, you can.** It may not fly off the shelf in a few days like earlier this year, but it’s still a great market for sellers. Unless you need to sell your home on Thanksgiving or Christmas, you have nothing to worry about.&nbsp;

So where is our market heading? Earlier this year, the market was crazy. Some homes were receiving upwards of 20 offers. Once we hit August, things began to slow down. This is typical, but this year, the effect was larger than usual. Whether this is because of the pandemic, the school year, or buyer fatigue, **August was probably the slowest month we’ll see all year.&nbsp;**

A lot of buyers that were in the market last spring have put their search on hold. Some of them are reentering the market, but there are likely more still waiting things out. Now that things have slowed down, **a lot of these highly motivated buyers will be looking to buy a home this fall and winter.&nbsp;**
