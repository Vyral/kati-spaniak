Sellers are prone to making a lot of mistakes. Pricing is one of the biggest, but it’s not the biggest. **In my opinion, the biggest mistake sellers make is not listening to their real estate agent.**

If you are working with an experienced real estate professional, you really need to listen to their advice. Plenty of people out there think they know better than their real estate agent, and that’s fine, but the truth is that they really don’t.&nbsp;

We’re in a tough situation because although we are salespeople, we are also consultants. Some people agents only give advice that will help their own bottom line, but this will never be the case if you work with a reputable professional. **The advice we give our clients is based on experience and knowledge and is designed to help you sell for the most money possible in the shortest period of time.**

You’ve got to listen to your real estate agent. If they’re telling you something over and over again, take a step back, listen, and realize that they know what they’re doing.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about your specific situation or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
