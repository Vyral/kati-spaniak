I’m excited to announce that my next home selling seminar is happening on Monday, November 12 at the Northbrook Public Library from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If you’re thinking of selling your home, you won’t want to miss it.&nbsp;

What can you learn by attending this seminar? Well, last month we hosted a seller seminar that received a great turnout, and I was able to share some of the most important tricks of the trade with those in attendance, including:

* What to look for in an agent
* How to properly prepare your home for the market
* How to sell quickly and for top dollar&nbsp;

To dive a little deeper and give you a better idea of what you can learn, I have a couple of clips from this seminar I’d like to share with you, starting at 0:46 in the video above.

In the first clip, I emphasize **the importance of pricing your home correctly from the very beginning.** The first four weeks your home is on the market is the time period it will see the most activity, and you want to be under contract during that time. If you price your home too high, you won’t attract any buyer attention or receive any offers until several weeks later. By that point, they’ll assume they’ll be able to get a good deal on your home, and they’ll probably be right, because by that time you’ll be exhausted from the whole process.&nbsp;

The second clip explains **how your home’s appraised value influences your sale.** Appraisers value your home by looking at the numbers. By that I mean its square footage, lot size, year built, etc. They’ll look at its updates, too, but only if those updates happened within the last 10 years.&nbsp;

Your home’s appraised value can be either higher or lower than its market value, but the appraised value is the number the buyer will have to meet to buy the house. If the buyer is in the middle of getting a mortgage but your house doesn’t appraise at its market value, one of three things will happen: You’ll have to reduce the home’s price to meet the appraised value, the buyer will have to pay more to cover the difference, or you’ll have to put the home back on the market.&nbsp;
