Instead of hammering you with stats, today I’ll offer a market update for the North Shore of Chicago based on my boots-on-the-ground experience. Generally speaking, it still holds that if a house is in good condition and priced correctly, it will definitely sell. But what’s the mood? What am I hearing day in and day out?&nbsp;

Taxes are a really big issue right now. Buyers nowadays are much smarter than they used to be it seems; they’re very aware that property taxes will continue to skyrocket here in Illinois. When they’re looking at houses, they’re factoring in taxes first. **A lot of high-tax houses are sitting, and will likely continue to sit. Sellers, there’s not much you can do about this, other than cut your price.&nbsp;**

In my opinion, it’s ridiculous that elected officials in our state can’t grasp the gravity of the situation unfolding. Let me make this clear: This isn’t intended to be a political commentary to sway Illinois voters one way or another; I’m just stating that if you keep raising property taxes in a state, people will eventually start leaving in droves, which, in turn, will decrease home values.&nbsp;

I had a buyer recently find a home to their liking way outside of the city for $250,000. The problem, however, was that the taxes on this property were $13,000. This blew their whole budget, and they had to pass on the home. Sadly, I just feel like the issue of exorbitant property taxes isn’t being addressed by our representatives.&nbsp;

**You must appeal your taxes every year.** If you need help with this, just let me know, as I can connect you with a trusted professional. If you know you’ll be selling and your taxes are high, you may want to give yourself a longer listing time to account for the fact that not as many buyers will be able to afford that aspect of your home.&nbsp;

Buyers in our market are availing themselves of all of the data available online these days, and, on average, are waiting a little longer to buy.&nbsp;

My overall feel of the North Shore market: **Things are selling but you have to make the necessary upgrades and do things right—cross your t’s and dot your i’s**. Again, with regard to the tax situation, it’s just painful for everyone. I’ve included some links to more of the statistical breakdown of the North Shore housing market below.&nbsp;

As always, if you have additional questions about this or any other real estate topic, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I’d love to hear from you.
