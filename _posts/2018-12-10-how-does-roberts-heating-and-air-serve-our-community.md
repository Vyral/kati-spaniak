Today I’m excited to be joined by Keith Miller of Roberts Heating and Air in Northbrook to talk about his life, his career, and his business.&nbsp;

**Roberts Heating and Air was started by Glenn Roberts in 1979.** In 1983, he asked Keith to join him and in 1990, Keith became a partner when they moved into their first shop. Early on, they did mostly residential service work and a bit of residential construction work. These days, they still do residential work, but have also added commercial work, retrofit replacement, and pretty much everything that has to do with heating and air conditioning.

**They’re currently located at 1847 Raymond Dr. in Northbrook, where Keith and Glenn both live.** Their team consists of about 20 members and includes those who assist with daily office work and customer service requests, as well as field employees like installers and service technicians.

The No. 1 question that Keith says he hears from his clients is, “Is my equipment safe?” To answer the question, they like to take their clients through a tune-up to come up with an answer. It all starts with simple maintenance.

**One of the biggest issues they see from their customers is equipment failure.** A lot of this can be solved with routine maintenance, but anytime equipment fails, the pressure is on—especially in extreme temperatures. Roberts prides themselves on being able to give same-day service to their clients.

Keith and his team believe that honesty is the best policy. They make their decisions and help their clients make decisions based on what’s best for them in the long term. **This includes recommending repairs, replacements, and tune-ups when needed to minimize costs over time.**

This family company is owned by two Northbrook natives who know what’s going on every day and are trying to follow up the best they can in any way with great, 24-7-365 service.
