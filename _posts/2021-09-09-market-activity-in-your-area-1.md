Today I'll talk about what a market search is and why you should be set up with one.

**A market search is a search for homes in your immediate area that you currently live in.** It shows you which homes are coming on the market and which homes have sold right in a defined area like a subdivision or a school district.&nbsp;

**Even if you don’t plan on moving, I can set you up on a market search for your area so that you can get that information.** You’ll know which houses are coming on the market in your area and you’ll get notified immediately. We always want to know what your neighbors' houses are selling for because that will affect your pricing strategy.

If you would like me to set you up with a market search for your area, reach out to me by email. There’s no obligation whatsoever. If you have any other questions, let me know how I can help you. I look forward to hearing from you.
