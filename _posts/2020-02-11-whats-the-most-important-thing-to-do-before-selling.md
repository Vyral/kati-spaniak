Today I’m answering the question, “What is the most important thing to do to your home before listing it for sale?”

**You may be surprised, but the answer is to paint.** Why is painting so important? It’s fresh, makes the home smell like it’s been updated, and can hide a lot of imperfections.&nbsp;

**I actually recommend painting over any other upgrade in terms of return on investment.**

You will need the right color to appeal to the most buyers possible. Unless you’re an interior decorator, I’d reach out to someone like myself for advice on paint color. We know what’s going on in the market and we know what colors the buyers want to see.

**If you have wooden doors, they need to be painted also.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions for me about painting or other things you can do to get your home ready for sale, feel free to reach out via phone or email. **We’d also love to see you at our next seminar on February 25 in Downtown Northbrook.** You can **[register here for free](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/downsizing-where-do-you-start-tickets-92269976985){: target="_blank"}**, and learn everything you need to know about selling a home, whether you’re ready to or not.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.
