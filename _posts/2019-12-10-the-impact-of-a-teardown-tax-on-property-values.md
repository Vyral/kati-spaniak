Today’s topic is affordable housing.

I bring this up because there is a new development opportunity that is likely coming to Northbrook in the near future: The Green Acres Country Club, a 127-acre parcel right off Dundee Road.&nbsp;

They’re already beginning the review process with the village board. Whenever there is a new housing development brought before the board, it starts a conversation about housing affordability and how we need to create an affordable housing fund and initiatives for people who are potential employees in Northbrook.

One portion of the affordable housing initiative is the teardown tax, which could have a different result than perhaps the board intends.

This is a complex issue with many facets, but if you have any questions about the teardown tax and preserving the property values here in Northbrook, I’m free to talk. All you have to do is reach out to me anytime and we can discuss it in more detail. I’d be happy to have a conversation with you.
