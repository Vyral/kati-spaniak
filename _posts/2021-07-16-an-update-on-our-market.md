June was a slow month for showings. We still had things go under contract, but you could feel the difference. I am starting to feel like we’re almost back to a normal market. There isn’t a lot of inventory, so buyers have put their plans on hold. I also think that people were excited about being able to go out again and weren’t focusing on buying a house. **What is the market going to be like going into autumn?**

I believe the market is going to pick up in September. We usually see an upswing in September and October. As people get more used to being back outside and once school's back in session, I think there's going to be more inventory coming onto the market, especially on the north shore of Chicago. **If you’re thinking about listing, now is the time.**

If you’re thinking about moving, the first thing you need to do is talk to your agent. Don't put any money into fixes or updates without knowing if you're going to get a return on it. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via phone or email.
