“What’s the difference between a real estate team and a real estate agent?” This is a question I hear all the time.

The main difference is the customer service. **If you work with an individual agent, they have to do everything at once.** This includes running listing sheets, entering data, negotiating inspection requests, and much more. If they have more than three listings at a time, it’s hard for them to manage sleep, let alone the transactions themselves.

**If you work with a real estate team like ours, there are multiple people servicing you at once.** Our Director of Operations is responsible for managing the office, and our listing manager only focuses on selling and marketing our listings. They are constantly doing things like reaching out to agents to see if clients are interested in our homes, which puts the houses back on their radar. Feedback is important to us, and it’s one of the reasons that we’re set up like this. Individual agents simply don’t have time.

We also have a transaction coordinator, who takes the home from contract to close. Following up with attorneys, inspectors, appraisers, and the buyer’s agents are just a few things this person does. In addition to answering questions that both sellers and buyers have about their move. We have a runner who is also available at any time to complete tasks, such as meeting vendors or bringing listing sheets over. In addition, the buyer’s agents on our team are completely focused on helping homebuyers get the best service possible.

What do I do? First of all, I oversee the team while also understanding the market and what’s going on with it at a high level. I relay this information to my clients. I also spend a considerable amount of time talking about pricing with the seller and negotiating. These are the things which are most important to a transaction. This allows me time for my clients to get a hold of me. **When they need something, they can reach out to me and I’m available.**

The high level of customer service is undeniable with a team, and you simply can’t get the same level of service with an individual agent. While some individual agents can provide a high level of customer service there is so much to do that the math doesn’t add up. You won’t get the attention you need, want, or deserve. **I think in the next 10 years, every real estate agent will be part of a team.**

If you want to get ahead of the trend by working with our team, or if you just have any questions about the market or your house, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
