I hosted a fantastic home seller seminar last night where I was able to talk openly and honestly to potential home sellers. **One of the first slides I put up during the seminar answered the question, “What does the market look like now?”** and I’d like to share that with you today.&nbsp;

As you can see in the video above, new listings on the North Shore have continually increased since the beginning of 2015. At that point, there was very little inventory. When the public started hearing that so many buyers were having a difficult time finding homes, that’s when they started listing homes again and that trend has continued to this day.

In another chart, you can see that closed sales continued to increase from 2015 through 2017, before dropping this year. If you are thinking about selling any time in the next year, it’s important to talk to a real estate agent. **You probably don’t want to wait until next spring.** There might be a huge spike in inventory and you might have a more difficult time selling.

If you are planning on selling, preparation and pricing are key. Your home has to look its best and it has to be priced correctly. If it’s not, you could lose tens of thousands of dollars on your final sale price.&nbsp;

If you are considering selling in 2019, we’d love for you to attend our next seller seminar. If you have any other questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
