If you’re thinking of selling your house, you probably have questions about what you can do to prepare it for the market. Well, you’re in luck, because we’re hosting a fantastic seller seminar soon, and you’re invited\!

**Join us on November 16 in downtown Northbrooke at 9:30 a.m. to learn the answers to the following questions and more:**

* When is the best time to list your house?
* What do you need to do to get your house ready to sell?
* What projects should you invest your money in?
* How do you buy and sell a home at the same time?
* If you can’t hold two houses at once, what can you do?
* What is a bridge loan?
* How can you get a mortgage if you’ve already retired and don’t have any income?
* How do you sell your house as a FSBO?
* How do you find and engage with a real estate attorney?
* Should you get a home inspection before you put your home on the market?
* How do you find the right real estate agent?

I promise this seminar will be incredibly informational to home sellers. Last year, one couple who attended ended up listing their home with me in the spring—they sold their house before it even went on the MLS\! Doug and Nancy gave me a fantastic testimonial, which you can look at [here.](https://www.google.com/search?q=spaniak+team&amp;oq=spaniak+&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60l2j69i61j69i60j69i61.4446j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#lrd=0x880fc7b178743b3d:0x5bd173c68442e476,1,,,){: target="_blank"}

I hope to see you there\! If you can’t make it, don’t worry—just give me a call or send me an email and we’ll be sure to get you the information you need as well as an invitation to the next seminar we host.
