Do you have a child grades 9-12 who is interested in STEM? If so, see belowâ€¦ or please share this post in any other groups you think might be interested.

I am giving away one scholarshipðŸŽ–to a deserving student 9-12th grade to attend&nbsp;[**Higher Orbits' Go For Launch**](https://higherorbits.org/go-for-launch/)&nbsp;two-day event in Spring Grove, Illinois on July 13 & 14.

This is an incredible not-for-profit that gives kids the chance to send an experiment to the International Space Station. I love ðŸ¤© Higher Orbits and its mission.
