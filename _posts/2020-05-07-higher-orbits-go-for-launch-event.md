Do you have a child grades 9-12 who is interested in STEM? If so, see below... or please share this post in any other groups you think might be interested.

I am giving away one scholarship to a deserving student 9-12th grade to attend Higher Orbits' Go For Launch two-day event in Spring Grove Illinois on July 13 & 14.

This is an incredible not-for-profit that gives kids the chance to send an experiment to the International Space Station. I love ðŸ¤© Higher Orbits and its mission.
