You may have heard that the best time to list your home is right after the Super Bowl. It makes sense, because that’s typically the signal of the start of the spring market. However, now it seems that everyone is privy to that information. Therefore, we’re anticipating a big spike in inventory right after the the big game.&nbsp;**That increased inventory means more competition for you as a seller.**

After that spike in inventory, we tend to see a lot of price reductions. These typically happen in mid to late summer when sellers and buyers alike become desperate. That’s why I think you should get a head start on the market. If you list sooner, you have a better chance to test the market.&nbsp;**I also think it gives you a much better chance at receiving a higher price.**

Even with the weather being cold outside, there are many people wondering when all the new inventory is going to come on the market. People are looking at homes now. I receive offers every day, no matter what time of year it is.

If you’re one of the few houses that’s on the market in the next few months and priced correctly, **you could receive multiple offers and be in a great position to sell before the spring market even starts.**

If you’re thinking about listing your home in the spring, call me now. I can help you get your home ready to beat the market. I would love to hear from you.
