What makes the Spaniak team great, rather than simply “good?”

Many of you may know the book “Good to Great” by Jim Collins. I’m currently reading this fantastic book about what makes companies great, rather than good, for the second time.

Allow me to share just one example from the book: The Stockdale Paradox, which is based on Jim Stockdale. A prisoner of war in Vietnam for eight years, Jim Stockdale was tortured over 20 times. While other POWs were optimistic about getting out, he knew the realities of his situation.

I was able to tie this story back to my business and team. A lot of times I will go into a house and do a market evaluation without really thinking about the realities of the situation. Sellers love to hear that you think you’ll be able to sell their home at a desirable price.

Still, **while you may believe that you can sell your home for that price, you need to think about the realities of the situation.** I think my team’s willingness to be honest is what makes us great.

I am willing to walk into any house and be completely honest about what price it should be listed at. As your consultant, I am going to be honest with you an make sure that you know the realities of the current market. We will talk it through and, if I think it is in your best interest not to sell and instead rent, I am going to talk to you about that tactfully.

This is because selling your home can be very traumatic and you want a real estate agent that is not just optimistic and tells you what you want to hear. **You need the agent that is able to push back a little and explain the reality but still be able to do what we can to get your house sold,** especially if you have to move because of finances, relocation, divorce, etc.

This is a very serious line of work and I take my job very seriously. This is what I think makes us go from good to great. I think we are great because I can tell you the honest truth and tell you how to get your house sold.

If you have any questions or are interested in buying or selling with my great team, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
