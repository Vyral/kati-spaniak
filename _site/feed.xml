        <title>Q: Why Should You Sell Now?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gBETpOX-lrw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre still trying to recover from the pandemic, and protests are happening all over the country. It seems like the world is in chaos. However, there are a few reasons why now is a great time to list your home for sale. Buyers are out looking for houses right now; they‚Äôre ready and anxious to move. Many sellers aren‚Äôt listing yet because they don‚Äôt want people walking through their homes amid the coronavirus, which means huge opportunities for those who do put their houses on the market now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also wrote an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://patch.com/illinois/northbrook/lack-home-inventory-north-shore-it-true?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article for Patch.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; on why now might be the best time to list your home for the most money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to me. I‚Äôm happy to help!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Which Houses Sell Fast in Our Current Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MqFmmk8NRQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve been talking about the importance of pricing for years. The market has changed a little bit, though, and buyers aren‚Äôt as concerned about price as they are about condition. &lt;strong&gt;Even if you‚Äôre priced correctly for your home‚Äôs condition, it‚Äôs a tough sale if there‚Äôs a lot of work that needs to be done.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When buyers go online, they won‚Äôt like homes that don‚Äôt look ready to go. They won‚Äôt see the house in person if there isn‚Äôt some emotional connection. If they do walk into your house and it has a lot of obvious deferred maintenance, it‚Äôs going to be a tough sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Homes that aren‚Äôt in good condition may not sell at all.%20http://localhost:4000/which-houses-sell-fast-in-our-current-market.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;‚ÄúHomes that aren‚Äôt in good condition may not sell at all.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you‚Äôre maybe a year or two out from selling, it‚Äôs time for you to take care of that deferred maintenance now.&lt;/strong&gt; Your roof, windows, HVAC system, etc., should all be checked and in proper working order. Your house needs to be in good condition to sell in this market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A buyer I worked with recently found a home that was on the market and in great condition. They loved that the roof was new, the mechanicals were in good working order, and the kitchen was fresh and updated with appliances. &lt;strong&gt;Everything in the house had been taken care of, so it was an easy sell.&lt;/strong&gt; There was nothing left in the house that needed to be ‚Äútaken care of.‚Äù The only thing that the buyers needed to do was customize it to their liking. This home sold over list price, as will most homes that are in good condition right now.¬† Homes that aren‚Äôt in good condition may not sell at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about the updates and upgrades you should make before you sell, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Market Update &amp; an Ugly Tax Reality</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3I245u4vW1A?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of hammering you with stats, today I‚Äôll offer a market update for the North Shore of Chicago based on my boots-on-the-ground experience. Generally speaking, it still holds that if a house is in good condition and priced correctly, it will definitely sell. But what‚Äôs the mood? What am I hearing day in and day out?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taxes are a really big issue right now. Buyers nowadays are much smarter than they used to be it seems; they‚Äôre very aware that property taxes will continue to skyrocket here in Illinois. When they‚Äôre looking at houses, they‚Äôre factoring in taxes first. &lt;strong&gt;A lot of high-tax houses are sitting, and will likely continue to sit. Sellers, there‚Äôs not much you can do about this, other than cut your price.¬†&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it‚Äôs ridiculous that elected officials in our state can‚Äôt grasp the gravity of the situation unfolding. Let me make this clear: This isn‚Äôt intended to be a political commentary to sway Illinois voters one way or another; I‚Äôm just stating that if you keep raising property taxes in a state, people will eventually start leaving in droves, which, in turn, will decrease home values.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a buyer recently find a home to their liking way outside of the city for $250,000. The problem, however, was that the taxes on this property were $13,000. This blew their whole budget, and they had to pass on the home. Sadly, I just feel like the issue of exorbitant property taxes isn‚Äôt being addressed by our representatives.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Buyers in our market are availing themselves of all of the data available online these days.%20http://localhost:4000/a-market-update-an-ugly-tax-reality.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;‚ÄúBuyers in our market are availing themselves of all of the data available online these days.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must appeal your taxes every year.&lt;/strong&gt; If you need help with this, just let me know, as I can connect you with a trusted professional. If you know you‚Äôll be selling and your taxes are high, you may want to give yourself a longer listing time to account for the fact that not as many buyers will be able to afford that aspect of your home.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers in our market are availing themselves of all of the data available online these days, and, on average, are waiting a little longer to buy.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My overall feel of the North Shore market: &lt;strong&gt;Things are selling but you have to make the necessary upgrades and do things right‚Äîcross your t‚Äôs and dot your i‚Äôs&lt;/strong&gt;. Again, with regard to the tax situation, it‚Äôs just painful for everyone. I‚Äôve included some links to more of the statistical breakdown of the North Shore housing market below.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have additional questions about this or any other real estate topic, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I‚Äôd love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Deals Fall Through</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSeU5lJ3M70?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we‚Äôre examining why deals fall through in our current market. It‚Äôs so painful having to go from contract to contract in attorney review; this period of time is when most difficulties arise, so we‚Äôll start off our message explaining exactly what attorney review is and how best to handle it.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most:¬†&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0:58 ‚Äî Keep your attorney review period as short as possible¬†&lt;br /&gt;2:12 ‚Äî Buyers backing out after making an offer, or requesting too much for a credit¬†&lt;br /&gt;3:25 ‚Äî Buyers and sellers getting emotional and losing perspective of the transaction¬†&lt;br /&gt;4:00 ‚Äî How a contingent offer can give buyers an upper hand&lt;br /&gt;5:13 ‚Äî Advice to sellers going into attorney review/advice to buyers for requesting credits&lt;br /&gt;6:24 ‚Äî Wrapping things up¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have further questions about this or any other real estate topic, please feel free to call, email, or explore our website. We‚Äôre always having seminars on how to sell your home (check the email that led you here for a link to more information on the next one). These events are very casual‚Äîno pressure at all, just come with questions and we‚Äôll be happy to help you.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What‚Äôs the Most Important Thing to Do Before Selling?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TWnCFOg7GJI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I‚Äôm answering the question, ‚ÄúWhat is the most important thing to do to your home before listing it for sale?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may be surprised, but the answer is to paint.&lt;/strong&gt; Why is painting so important? It‚Äôs fresh, makes the home smell like it‚Äôs been updated, and can hide a lot of imperfections.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I actually recommend painting over any other upgrade in terms of return on investment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=You will need the right color to appeal to the most buyers possible.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-the-most-important-thing-to-do-before-selling.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;‚ÄúYou will need the right color to appeal to the most buyers possible.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need the right color to appeal to the most buyers possible. Unless you‚Äôre an interior decorator, I‚Äôd reach out to someone like myself for advice on paint color. We know what‚Äôs going on in the market and we know what colors the buyers want to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you have wooden doors, they need to be painted also.¬†&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about painting or other things you can do to get your home ready for sale, feel free to reach out via phone or email. &lt;strong&gt;We‚Äôd also love to see you at our next seminar on February 25 in Downtown Northbrook.&lt;/strong&gt; You can &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/downsizing-where-do-you-start-tickets-92269976985&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;register here for free&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and learn everything you need to know about selling a home, whether you‚Äôre ready to or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing from you soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Downsizing the Right Way</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/E-6hZ6d122s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre over the age of 50, you‚Äôll probably want to start thinking about downsizing. Perhaps your kids are grown up and off to college, and it‚Äôs time to think about the next stage in your life.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downsizing is a topic I discuss with people all the time, and &lt;strong&gt;the first thing you need to know is where you‚Äôll go.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôd say that three out of every five sellers I currently work with are moving out of state or renting, and one of the reasons why is they can‚Äôt find the housing they‚Äôre looking for. There aren‚Äôt a lot of great downsizing options on the North Shore. This is why you have to start looking for homes early and know what you‚Äôre looking for.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, there aren‚Äôt a lot of large ranches in maintenance-free communities because they take up a lot of space. If you do find one of these properties in a maintenance-free community, it will be very expensive. When it comes to downsizing, something usually has to give in terms of what you want in a home.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Millennials want homes to look move-in ready.%20http://localhost:4000/downsizing-the-right-way.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;‚ÄúMillennials want homes to look move-in ready.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;strong&gt;think about how you‚Äôll sell your home.&lt;/strong&gt; Millennial buyers are different than the buyers that were around when I bought my home. They look at things differently, and their priorities are not your priorities. You have to consider the fact that you‚Äôll have to target your house to a whole new market and understand that demographic.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By and large, millennials want homes to look move-in ready. They‚Äôre not willing to take on many projects; they‚Äôd rather have everything updated. This is why, no matter what your downsizing timeline is, you need to talk to an agent sooner rather than later so that you understand your new target market. Where should you spend your money (and where shouldn‚Äôt you)?¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you‚Äôre serious about downsizing the right way, &lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôm hosting a seminar that will cover this topic in-depth on January 29 at my office.&lt;/strong&gt; Sellers who‚Äôve attended my previous seminars found it very informative because I offer all of my insight, whether you hire me as your agent or not. At this seminar, I‚Äôll go over the downsizing process step by step, so if you‚Äôre, say, five years away from actually downsizing, I highly recommend attending. Space is limited, so &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/downsizing-where-do-you-start-tickets-83655904061&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;use this link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to register now and find out the rest of the details. ¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can‚Äôt make it but you have more questions about this topic, feel free to call or email me. I‚Äôd love to speak with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Impact of a Teardown Tax on Property Values</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/g1U1AQ__6fg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today‚Äôs topic is affordable housing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bring this up because there is a new development opportunity that is likely coming to Northbrook in the near future: The Green Acres Country Club, a 127-acre parcel right off Dundee Road.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôre already beginning the review process with the village board. Whenever there is a new housing development brought before the board, it starts a conversation about housing affordability and how we need to create an affordable housing fund and initiatives for people who are potential employees in Northbrook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One portion of the affordable housing initiative is the teardown tax, which could have a different result than perhaps the board intends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feel free to follow along in the video above, or else you can use the timestamps I‚Äôve provided below to navigate the conversation at your leisure:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1:13‚ÄîThe teardown tax¬†&lt;br /&gt;3:31‚ÄîThe importance of communication when it comes to the subject of housing affordability&lt;br /&gt;5:10‚ÄîHow the teardown tax might actually hurt residents in Northbrook&lt;br /&gt;6:20‚ÄîBalancing the concerns about affordable housing with concerns about the area residents&lt;br /&gt;7:31‚ÄîStarting an important conversation in support of our residents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a complex issue with many facets, but if you have any questions about the teardown tax and preserving the property values here in Northbrook, I‚Äôm free to talk. All you have to do is reach out to me anytime and we can discuss it in more detail. I‚Äôd be happy to have a conversation with you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Should You Not Hire Me?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UP4n-HYwbAY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I am going to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhy should you not hire me as your real estate agent?‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly, it‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt want the genuine truth. I am honest with my clients. &lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôm pretty blunt and frank.&lt;/strong&gt; I‚Äôm going to present it to you the way that I see it. I try to make it a bit softer, but I don‚Äôt want my clients to be in a position where a year or two after they‚Äôve listed their house, they‚Äôre still on the market. I will be 100% honest with you even if you don‚Äôt like the answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a real-life example. I was in a situation about a year and a half ago where I went to give a price estimate and the homeowners were interviewing three agents. I gave them a price of $649,000, but if they needed to sell immediately, I said $599,000. I was not chosen, they went with the agent that priced it at $769,000, which was way too high for the market. However, the other agent said, ‚ÄúYeah, we‚Äôll do it, we can get that.‚Äù¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, after six months that listing expired and they thought it was the agent‚Äôs fault when it wasn‚Äôt. Then they went with an agent that reduced it to $699,000. After that, it had to be reduced to $639,000, then $629,000, and finally, they decreased to $599,000, the price I had given them, 14 months later. Now, they still have not closed after 16 months on the market. So, they had carrying costs, time aggravation, and showing irritations.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=I will be 100% honest with you even if you don‚Äôt like the answer.%20http://localhost:4000/why-should-you-not-hire-me.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;‚ÄúI will be 100% honest with you even if you don‚Äôt like the answer.‚Äù&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Showing your house can be an agonizing experience&lt;/strong&gt; and having showings and being ready for showings every day is arduous. Imagine being on the market for 16 months! Maybe they simply didn‚Äôt like me, but the point is that they didn‚Äôt listen to what I was saying as being valid. It‚Äôs fine to do that, but it ended up costing them time and money.¬†&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work with an agent who you can trust and who knows the market. I do not want people to overspend on improvements on their home. I want people to sell their houses and sell quickly. To that end, our clients can cancel their listing agreement with us at any time because if they feel we are not being forthright, we want them to feel that they can leave. This allows us to have an improved conversation with our clients about the market. We‚Äôre telling you the truth about what will get your house sold. It‚Äôs up to you now to decide where you want to go with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions, want to chat, or you want an estimate on your home with no obligation, feel free to reach out. The easiest way is to email me but I‚Äôm also available by phone or text as well. I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;/p&gt;
